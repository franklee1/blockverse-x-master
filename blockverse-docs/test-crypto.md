# Receiving test crypto on Blockverse

## Step 1) Retrieve Exchange Wallet Address
In order to get test currency, first visit the funds page, and open the deposit section of the crypto for which you require test currency. For this guide, we will use bitcoins testnet in order to get some test bitcoins, which we can then use on the exchange to trade.

The deposit section of bitcoin will contain an address to which you will be depositing your test currency. If you do not see an address, simply refresh. Copy the address as you will require this in a moment. From there, use a testnet faucet in order to receive test currencies.

## Step 3) Wait for Confirmation to Receive Test Crypto Assets

Each transaction, such as the one that you generated above, requires a certain amount of confirmations before the test crypto is deposited to your wallet. This is a practice followed by every exchange. 
Currently, at 0 confirmations, the assets will be locked until a confirmation is made. 
After 1 confirmation, the test crypto will be deposited to your address within the exchange, and you will see an update to your balance as well as within the deposit history section with the updated confirmations.
